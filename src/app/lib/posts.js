        <p>Starting in the world of programming can feel like navigating a vast ocean. For me, the journey began not with a grand plan, but with a simple curiosity about how websites worked. I remember inspecting the source code of my favorite sites, mesmerized by the complex web of HTML and CSS that brought them to life.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">My first real project was a simple portfolio, much like this one. It was a challenge, filled with moments of frustration and triumph. I spent hours debugging CSS, learning the nuances of JavaScript, and finally deploying something I could call my own. That feeling of creating something from nothing was, and still is, incredibly rewarding.</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3 text-sky-400">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Don't try to build a massive application on day one. Small, achievable projects build confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Embrace the struggle:</strong> Debugging is a core part of development. Every error is a learning opportunity.</li>
          <li><strong>Community is key:</strong> I wouldn't have gotten far without online communities, tutorials, and open-source projects.</li>
        </ul>
